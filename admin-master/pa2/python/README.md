### Python Flask notes for PA2

1. Since you are extending functionality from your website in PA1, copy and paste your previous code into the new directory. 

2. You should use new port for pa2 which is your pa1 ports add 200. don't use pa1's ports for pa2, since we need some time to grade your pa1.

   For example, if your group ports for pa1 are `5697`  `6697`, your ports for pa2 are `5897` and `6897`

   To use the new ports for Flask, you'll just have to change your gunicorn command to use the new ports.
